# CTF-Public
This is a public repo where I place scripts and things that I have made while doing ctfs, or just for fun. 

# Bandit-overthewire.org
This is the collection of scripts I made to go through overthewire.org's bandit wargame. 
The scripts do not contain the passwords or any extensive information about the games, as that is against the rules that overthewire sets out for their players.
